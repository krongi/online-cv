    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My career in technology goes as far back as I can remember. I have always enjoyed all things tech. This enjoyment eventually led me to earning small amounts of money doing things like 
      reinstalling OS, troubleshooting applications and hardware and working around limitations. Eventually this would lead me to college to acquire more formal training.
      During my career I have set out to learn as much as I could through many different resources from formal training to Youtube and self teaching with books, manuals and experimentation
